                <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the breast. It is one of the most
                    common cancers worldwide, affecting millions of people, particularly women, although men can also
                    develop it. Early detection and treatment are essential for improving the outcomes of breast
                    cancer.</p>

                    <p>Breast cancer may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. However, as the cancer
                        progresses, some common signs and symptoms include:</p>
                </SpeakParagraph>

                <ul className="ms-4 my-2">
                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Lump or thickening:</strong> A new lump or mass in the breast or underarm is often
                            the most common sign of breast cancer. It can be painless, hard, or have irregular edges.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Changes in breast size or shape:</strong> A sudden change in the size, shape, or
                            appearance of the breast may indicate a problem.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Skin changes:</strong> The skin of the breast may become red, dimpled (resembling
                            an orange peel), or thickened.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Nipple discharge:</strong> Discharge from the nipple, particularly if it is bloody
                            or occurs without squeezing, can be a sign of breast cancer.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>

                            breast pain should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.
                        </li>

                    <p>The exact causes of breast cancer are not fully understood, but a combination of genetic,
                        environmental, and lifestyle factors may contribute to its development. Some known causes and

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Genetic mutations:</strong> Certain inherited genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and
                            BRCA2, increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>

                            breast cancer increases the risk of the disease.
                        </li>

                    <SpeakParagraph>

                            menstruation or late menopause, can elevate breast cancer risk.

                    <p>Diagnosing breast cancer involves a variety of tests, and it is crucial to visit a medical center
                        if any symptoms are present or during routine check-ups. Common diagnostic methods include:</p>

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Mammogram:</strong> A low-dose X-ray of the breast used to detect abnormalities or
                            lumps. It is one of the most effective early screening tools for breast cancer.

                            of the breast tissue, often used to examine lumps found during a physical exam or mammogram.

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Biopsy:</strong> A biopsy involves removing a small sample of breast tissue to
                            determine if it contains cancerous cells. This is the definitive test for diagnosing breast
                            cancer.

                    <SpeakParagraph>
                        <li><strong>- Surgery:</strong> Surgical options may involve a lumpectomy (removing the tumor)
                            or mastectomy (removing one or both breasts). Lymph nodes may also be removed to check for
                            cancer spread.

                            hormonal therapy may be used to block the effects of estrogen or progesterone, which can
                            promote cancer growth.
